## Welcome to my Portfolio!

I created this using the newly released FastHTML framework created by Jeremy Howard, the mind behind FastAI.
I may not be the first one to create a Terminal-Styled portfolio, but I hope I'm the first to create one using FastHTML.

I started doing this purely to learn FastHTML, and ended up liking what I did (After a few attempts at creating a portfolio with various technologies). 
After a (slightly) tough time trying to figure out a way to deploy this in Google App Engine, I thought it might be useful for someone to use my portfolio as an example to achieve the same. So here it goes, I've included my app.yaml!
